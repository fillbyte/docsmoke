# Support

Use the right channel so questions and fixes land in the right place.

## Q&A and usage help

Use GitHub Discussions for:

- installation help
- CI and GitHub Actions setup
- deciding how to mark snippets
- interpreting docsmoke reports
- choosing flags such as `--all-supported`, `--fail-fast`, or `--config`

Start here:

- Q&A: <https://github.com/fillbyte/docsmoke/discussions/categories/q-a>
- Ideas: <https://github.com/fillbyte/docsmoke/discussions/categories/ideas>
- Show and tell: <https://github.com/fillbyte/docsmoke/discussions/categories/show-and-tell>

## Open an issue when

- a documented command does not work as described
- snippet discovery misses or misclassifies Markdown blocks
- a report renderer emits malformed output
- a supported Python version regressed
- documentation contains copy-paste-broken or misleading examples

## Do not open a public issue for

- vulnerabilities in `docsmoke` itself
- secrets, tokens, or private repository details

Use the private security reporting flow instead:

- [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md)
- <https://github.com/fillbyte/docsmoke/security/advisories/new>

## Contribution fit

If your idea changes the project's scope substantially, open a discussion
first. `docsmoke` aims to stay focused on executable documentation smoke
tests rather than becoming a full Markdown linter or documentation platform.
