# Repository settings

This checklist captures the GitHub settings that cannot be enforced from the
source tree alone. Keep it in sync with branch rules and release automation.

The canonical repository is `fillbyte/docsmoke`.

## General

- Default branch: `main`
- Merge strategy: squash merge enabled; merge commits disabled
- Discussions enabled for support and ideas
- Issues enabled with blank issues disabled
- Projects and wiki disabled unless they become actively maintained

## Branch protection

Protect `main` with:

- Require a pull request before merging
- Require at least one approving review
- Require review from Code Owners
- Dismiss stale approvals when new commits are pushed
- Require conversation resolution before merging
- Require status checks to pass before merging
- Require branches to be up to date before merging
- Require linear history
- Restrict force pushes and deletions

Required checks:

- `Python 3.10`
- `Python 3.11`
- `Python 3.12`
- `Python 3.13`
- `Python 3.14`
- `Build distribution`
- `Build container image`

## Actions

- Allow GitHub Actions and reusable workflows
- Allow actions from GitHub, verified creators, and pinned third-party actions
- Require approval for first-time contributors
- Set workflow token permissions to read-only by default
- Allow selected workflows to request elevated permissions explicitly

## Environments

Create a `pypi` environment:

- Required reviewers: maintainers
- Deployment branches/tags: release tags matching `v*.*.*`
- Used by `.github/workflows/release.yml` for PyPI Trusted Publishing
- PyPI publisher identity: owner `fillbyte`, repository `docsmoke`, workflow
  `release.yml`, environment `pypi`

Create a `github-pages` environment:

- Used by `.github/workflows/pages.yml`
- Deployment source: GitHub Actions

## Security

Enable:

- Private vulnerability reporting
- Dependabot alerts
- Dependabot security updates
- Secret scanning
- Push protection for detected secrets
- Code scanning alerts when CodeQL is enabled for the repository

CodeQL default setup should be enabled for Python with the default query
suite and weekly schedule.

## Labels

Baseline labels expected by issue templates:

- `bug`
- `enhancement`
- `needs-triage`
- `documentation`
- `security`
- `ci`

## Release tags

- Exact package/action tags use `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, for example `v1.0.4`
- Moving action tags use `vMAJOR`, for example `v1`
- Exact release tags should be immutable after a successful release
- Moving action tags are force-updated by release automation
