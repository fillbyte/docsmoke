Executable documentation smoke tests for Markdown.

`docsmoke` is maintained by [Fillbyte](https://github.com/fillbyte) as part of
its open-source developer tooling.

`docsmoke` runs the shell and Python examples you mark in `README.md`,
`docs/`, and onboarding guides, then fails CI when those examples stop
matching reality. It is intentionally small: opt-in fenced blocks,
inline expectations, deterministic timeouts, and reports that fit pull
requests.

## Why Maintainers Use It

- **Docs fail like code** — quickstarts, install commands, and CLI examples
  run in CI instead of quietly rotting.
- **Markdown-native** — authors keep examples in ordinary fenced blocks.
- **Opt-in by default** — only snippets marked for `docsmoke` execute unless
  you explicitly choose `--all-supported`.
- **Assert behavior** — expectations, regexes, timeouts, working directories,
  environment overrides, skips, and shell overrides live next to the example.
- **CI-native** — console, JSON, and Markdown reports work in local terminals,
  GitHub Actions, and release gates.
- **Supply-chain aware** — releases publish to PyPI, GitHub Releases, GHCR,
  and the reusable GitHub Action with SBOMs and Sigstore bundles.

## Use It When

- your README contains copy-paste commands that users rely on
- your docs include shell or Python examples that should keep working
- you want a narrow documentation gate in CI
- you want to verify examples without adopting a full documentation platform

## Reach for Other Tools When

- you need prose style linting or grammar checks
- you need full notebook execution
- you need browser-based end-to-end tests
- you want to run arbitrary untrusted snippets without sandboxing

## Quick Start

```bash
pipx install docsmoke
docsmoke --help
```

Detailed installation: [`docs/INSTALL.md`](docs/INSTALL.md).

## Mark Runnable Snippets

Put `docsmoke` after the language in the fenced block's info string.
The first word, `bash`, still controls Markdown syntax highlighting; the
second word, `docsmoke`, is the opt-in marker that tells the scanner to
execute the block.

````markdown
```bash docsmoke
# docsmoke: name=hello; expect-contains=hello
printf 'hello\n'
```
````

Run a scan:

```bash docsmoke
# docsmoke: name=scan-examples
docsmoke scan examples --quiet
```

List what would run:

```bash docsmoke
# docsmoke: expect-contains=example-snippet
docsmoke list-snippets examples --json
```

## Directive Syntax

Directives live in the first lines of a runnable fenced block:

````markdown
```bash docsmoke
# docsmoke: name=install-check
# docsmoke: cwd=examples
# docsmoke: expect-contains=hello
printf 'hello\n'
```
````

Supported directives:

- `name=<value>`: human-friendly snippet label
- `cwd=<path>`: working directory relative to the project root
- `timeout=<seconds>`: positive per-snippet timeout
- `expect-contains=<text>`: required stdout or stderr substring
- `expect-regex=<pattern>`: required regex match against stdout or stderr
- `env.NAME=<value>`: environment variable override
- `shell=<binary>`: shell override for shell snippets
- `skip[=true|false]`: skip the snippet without removing it

## GitHub Action

Use the moving `@v1` tag to receive compatible `1.x` fixes automatically, or
pin an exact release such as `@v1.0.6` for fully reproducible workflow inputs.

```yaml
- uses: fillbyte/docsmoke@v1
  with:
    paths: README.md docs examples
```

## Distribution Options

- **PyPI** — best for `pipx`, virtualenvs, and Python-based tooling.
- **GHCR** — best when CI prefers a pinned container image.
- **GitHub Action** — best when docs validation already lives in Actions.

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/work" -w /work \
    ghcr.io/fillbyte/docsmoke:latest scan README.md docs examples
```

Use `:latest` for convenience, `:1` for the moving stable major line, or
`:1.0.6` for a fully pinned container.

Published images include native `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` manifests, so
the same tags run on x86-64 Linux and Apple Silicon container hosts.

## Sample Output

```text
docsmoke
passed  examples/README.md:5  bash  0.004s  ok

Summary: total=1 passed=1 failed=0 skipped=0 errors=0
```
