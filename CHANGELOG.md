## [Unreleased]

- Prepared repository, Pages, Action, GHCR, and package metadata URLs for the
  `fillbyte/docsmoke` ownership transfer without changing the established
  `docsmoke` distribution, import, or CLI names.
- Added a verified GitHub/PyPI transfer runbook, narrowed release-job
  permissions, validated distributions with Twine, and prevented moving the
  public release/action tag before PyPI and GHCR publishing succeed.
- Expanded README, installation, usage, architecture, and repository docs to
  match the release/documentation quality bar of `surface-audit`.
- Added practical CI, Docker, gradual-adoption, and JSON-consumer recipes.
- Added a JSON report schema and schema validation regression test.
- Refreshed the GitHub Pages site with richer project positioning, release
  surfaces, sample output, and documentation links.
- Added Dependabot tracking for Dockerfile base image updates.
- Added Python 3.14 CI coverage and a container-image build check for
  Dockerfile changes.
